##Original Specs:

Option 3: Voting Booth

Make an application that lets users create yes or no questions and send a link to people to vote on them. You don't need to add in emailing capabilities -- just give the user the link they need to send to friends.

You'll need users to create the questions, and probably want users in order to vote -- otherwise, the same person could vote over and over. Maybe you could figure out a way to prevent that with the session.

Each question has its own URL and if you've voted, you see the results. If you haven't, you can vote.

Nice to have
Show a pie chart when you show results -- maybe Chartkick would help? http://chartkick.com/
Allow questions with multiple choice, not just yes or no
Have a page for each user where they can see all their questions
Put a time limit on questions. After the question's end date, no one can vote and everyone can see results.
Let people add comments on questions they've answered (or have run out of time to vote)

Things to learn
Creating users
Preventing multiple votes per user
How would you store a question that could have multiple answers?
